          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            George Sigety is a current Computer Science major at Boston College,
            pursuing a Bachelor of Arts with a minor in Accounting for Finance
            and Consulting, anticipated in May 2025. He has a strong foundation
            in programming and networking, demonstrated through coursework in
            Wireless and Mobile Networks and Computer Networks. His passion for
            technology is complemented by his leadership roles, including
            serving as President of the Boston College Cooking Club, where he
            manages events for a club with over 1,000 members, and as an E-board
            Member of the Boston College Computer Science Society, organizing
            workshops and meetings for fellow tech enthusiasts. Currently, he
            works as a Teacher's Assistant for the Wireless and Mobile Networks
            course, helping students grasp complex concepts and manage course
            materials. His practical experience extends to software development,
            having contributed to projects like a Ruby on Rails application for
            class waitlisting at Boston College and developing a prototype for a
            medical lab testing service at Navus Health. In addition to his
            technical skills in programming languages such as C, Python, Swift,
            Ruby, and Java, he has a creative side with proficiency in Adobe
            Photoshop and Illustrator. He recently completed a Spanish Language
            Immersion program in Madrid, enhancing his cultural understanding
            and communication skills. Outside of academia, he enjoys cooking,
            playing guitar, and staying active through skiing and crew. As he
            continues his journey in the tech world, he is excited to combine
            his programming skills with his passion for leadership and
            collaboration to create innovative solutions.

          <p>
            A rails app to allow BC students to submit waitlist requests for
            desired classes. The app collects Boston College course and
            registration data from the EagleApps API (not included in this repo
            sadly) and allows users to search through it to find a section to
            submit a waitlist request for. Persists very little data in the
            database, as all data apart from user data is pulled from and posted
            to the EagleApps API. Uses the ruby gems devise, omniauth (google
            oauth), httparty, and rolify. Built with rails 7.0.7 and ruby 3.2.2.

            An on campus food delivery app built in Swift/UI. Users have the
            ability to submit requests for food delivery, as well as accept
            these requests as a deliverer. In return for delivering food to
            students, deliverers will be able to buy themselves a meal on the
            requester's meal plan card. Implements messeging with real-time
            pulls from cloud firestore.
